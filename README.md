# Cart

A test someone asked me to do.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Installation

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Data

Data comes from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/ and is handled using own async middleware.

### Tests

Includes two tests for fetching and displaying the cart items and subsequently deleting them.

```sh
$ npm test
```
